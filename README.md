- 🔨 More about me: I really like the quote "Work smart, not hard!" but I belive that is not entierly true, 
because you know... to work smart first you need to work hard to understand the problem, to get your hands dirty
with hard stuff, to recognize what can be improved and what needs to be done to work smart. In less words, to
already have experience. :)
